# About
> Adaptive triggers are a feature in modern gaming controllers, most notably in the PlayStation DualSense controller for the PlayStation 5 (PS5). They use built-in motors to provide variable levels of resistance and feedback on the controller's triggers (L2 and R2 buttons). This feature enhances immersion in gameplay by simulating the physical sensations of in-game actions.
